Deliver me, out of my sadness
Deliver me, from all of the madness
Deliver me, courage to guide me
Deliver me, strength from inside me

All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found You
I know that You're the one to pull me through

Deliver me, loving and caring
Deliver me, giving and sharing

All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found you
I know that You're the one to pull me through

Deliver me
Deliver me
Oh, deliver me

All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found You
I know that You're the one to pull me through

All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found you
I know that You're the one to pull me through

Deliver me
Won't you deliver me?
