Back in 2019, we were unhappy with LaTeX and how slow and unwieldy it was. While its output quality surpassed everything else, it was simply a hassle to use. Just for fun, we started developing our own language, thinking it wouldn't be too hard to create something better. Since then we've realized just how big of a project we have taken on. But we've also seen Typst grow and evolve day by dayâ€”and we cannot wait to see what people will do with it.
